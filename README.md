Sudoku Puzzle Solver

This is a work in progress to reduce a sudoku puzzle down and potentially solve 
easy puzzles. I'll be fixing this up a lot soon as there are some obvious 
shortcuts taken and need for more C++11 updates.

board.txt is an example input file that can be used.

Implemented on a MacBook Pro using clang++ -std=c++11.
